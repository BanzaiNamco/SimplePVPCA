# SimplePVPCA

This CA is based on the method of eating in chess with a few twists.

In this CA, soldiers (turtles) in different camps from a faction (based on their color) will roam around the map and attack enemies. Similar to how attacking in chess works, when a soldier lands on a patch, they will deal damage to a random hostile soldier on the same patch if there is one.

The battle ends when only one faction is left on the battlefield.

There are also three types of soldiers and they are as follows:
1. Shielder (HP: 200, DMG: 10, Reach: 2)
2. Bruiser (HP: 100, DMG: 20, Reach: 3)
3. DPS (HP: 50, DMG: 45, Reach: 5)

Term Glossary:
HP - Hit points, a unit's remaining life
DMG - Amount of damage a unit will deal to a hostile
Reach - Number of spaces a unit can move forward
